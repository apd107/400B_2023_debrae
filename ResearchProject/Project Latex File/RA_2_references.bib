    journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
    abstract = {Indications of disequilibrium throughout the Milky Way (MW) highlight the need for compact, flexible, non-parametric descriptions of phase–space distributions of galaxies. We present a new representation of the current dark matter (DM) distribution and potential derived from N-body simulations of the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) system using basis function expansions (BFEs). We incorporate methods to maximize the physical signal in the representation. As a result, the simulations of 108 DM particles representing the distorted MW(MW+LMC) system can be described by ∼236(2067) coefficients. We find that the LMC induces asymmetric perturbations (odd l, m) to the MW’s halo, which are inconsistent with oblate, prolate, or triaxial halos. Furthermore, the energy in high order even modes (l, m &gt; 2) is similar to average triaxial halos found in cosmological simulations. As such, the response of the MW’s halo to the LMC must be accounted for in order to recover the imprints of its assembly history. The LMC causes the outer halo (&gt;30 kpc) to shift from the disk center of mass (COM) by ∼15–25 kpc at present day, manifesting as a dipole in the BFE and in the radial velocities of halo stars. The shift depends on the LMC’s infall mass, the distortion of the LMC’s halo and the MW halo response.Within 30 kpc, halo tracers are expected to orbit the COM of the MW’s disk, regardless of LMC infall mass. The LMC’s halo is also distorted by MW tides; we discuss the implications for its mass loss and the subsequent effects on current Magellanic satellites.}

    abstract = "{In this work, we aim at investigating the effects of baryons on the dark matter (DM) haloes structure, focusing on the correlation between the presence and importance of stellar discs and the halo shapes. We study the properties of a subsample of DM haloes from Fenix and eagle cosmological simulations. We inspect the central regions of haloes in the mass range \\$[10.9-992.3] \\times 10^\\{10\\} \\ \\rm M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$ at z = 0, comparing the hydrodynamic runs and their dark matter only (DMo) counterparts. Our results indicate that baryons have a significant impact on the shape of the inner halo, mainly within ∼20 per cent of the virial radius. We find haloes to be more spherical when hosting baryons. While the impact of baryons depends on the mass of the haloes, we also find a trend with morphology which suggests that the way baryons are assembled is also relevant in agreement with previous works. Our findings also indicate that disc galaxies preferentially form in haloes whose DMo counterparts were originally more spherical and with stronger velocity anisotropy. The presence of baryons alter the orbital structure of the DM particles of the haloes, which show a decrease in their velocity anisotropy, towards more tangentially biased orbits. This relative decrease is weaker in the case of disc-dominated galaxies. Our results point out to a cosmological connection between the final morphology of galaxies and the intrinsic properties of their DM haloes, which gets reinforce by the growth of the discs.}",

    title = {The Recent LMC–SMC Collision: Timing and Impact Parameter Constraints from Comparison of Gaia LMC Disk Kinematics and N-body Simulations},
    journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
    abstract = {We present analysis of the proper-motion (PM) field of the red clump stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk using the Gaia Early Data Release 3 catalog. Using a kinematic model based on old stars with 3D velocity measurements, we construct the residual PM field by subtracting the center-of-mass motion and internal rotation motion components. The residual PM field reveals asymmetric patterns, including larger residual PMs in the southern disk. Comparisons of the observed residual PM field with those of five numerical simulations of an LMC analog that is subject to the tidal fields of the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) show that the present-day LMC is not in dynamical equilibrium. We find that both the observed level of disk heating (PM residual rms of 0.057 ± 0.002 mas yr−1) and kinematic asymmetry are not reproduced by Milky Way tides or if the SMC impact parameter is larger than the size of the LMC disk. This measured level of disk heating provides a novel and important method to validate numerical simulations of the LMC–SMC interaction history. Our results alone put constraints on an impact parameter ≲10 kpc and impact timing &lt;250 Myr. When adopting the impact timing constraint of ∼140–160 Myr ago from previous studies, our results suggest that the most recent SMC encounter must have occurred with an impact parameter of ∼5 kpc. We also find consistent radial trends in the kinematically and geometrically derived disk inclination and line-of-node position angles, indicating a common origin.}
